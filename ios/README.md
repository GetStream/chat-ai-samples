# [Swift UI](https://getstream.io/tutorials/ios-chat/) AI components Sample App

This repository contains a sample AI assistant app that integrates Stream's [AI UI components](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift-ai.git), as well as the [ StreamChatSwiftUI SDK](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swiftui.git). The sample shows how to render responses from LLM providers such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic or any custom backend by using our AI components and server-side SDKs. Our UI components are able to render Markdown, Code blocks, tables, thinking indicators, images, etc.

The sample shows you how to integrate the following views:
- `StreamingMessageView` - a component that is able to render text, markdown and code in real-time, using character-by-character animation, similar to ChatGPT.
- `AITypingIndicatorView` - a component that can display different states of the LLM (thinking, checking external sources, etc).

These components are designed to work seamlessly with our existing Swift UI [Chat SDK](https://getstream.io/tutorials/ios-chat/). Our [developer guide](https://getstream.io/chat/solutions/ai-integration/) explains how to get started building AI integrations with Stream and Swift UI. 

The app consists of the standard StreamChat channel list and channel view. The channel view is enhanced with a button to start and stop AI agents. When the agent is started, it listens to all the sent messages in the channel and connects to an LLM to receive AI-generated responses.

There's also an example that shows you how to present the different states of the LLM, by reacting to the new AI events in the SDK. Additionally, you will learn how to stop the generation of messages at any time, using the `AIIndicatorStopEvent`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Running the app is simple. If you are going to use our default server, just open Xcode, wait until the packages are downloaded and press run.

If you want to use your own server, make sure to update `StreamAIChatService`'s `baseURL` value on line 13, to your own server.
