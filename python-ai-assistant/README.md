## AI Assistant Python

This repo contains a sample project that shows you how you can integrate StreamChat with AI services, such as Anthropic.

The project exposes three endpoints:
- `/start-ai-agent` - this will create an AI agent, that will join a channel where it was invoked from.
- `/stop-ai-agent` - this will stop the AI agent and leave the channel.
- `/new-message` - reacts to new messages in a channel triggering a response from the AI agent.

Depending on your use-case, you can call these either on channel appearance or by tapping on a UI element (e.g. Ask AI button).

> Warning: The usage of a Python backend requirese some changes to the React application if you want to test it. Specifically it is necessary to change the trigger of the AI agent button to listen to members of a channel instead of watchers. This is due to a limitation of the Python SDK to not support watchers as of now.

## Usage

In order to run the server locally, you would need to perform the following steps:

### Setup the `.env` file

There's a `.env.example` that you can use as a template. You should provide values for the following keys in your `.env` file:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=insert_your_key
STREAM_API_KEY=insert_your_key
STREAM_API_SECRET=insert_your_secret
```

### Install the dependencies

We use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as a framework. We also recommend using a virtual environment for the project. To create one we run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then we can activate it like this:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then, we can install the necessary dependencies that are listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file. To do this run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Running the project

In order to run the project, you should run:

```
python main.py
```

This will start listening for requests on localhost:8001.

You need to be able to listen to new messages using a Websocket. To configure this, follow the steps in the [blog post](https://getstream.io/blog/python-assistant/#listen-to-messages-using-a-webhook).

## Starting the AI Agent

When `start-ai-agent` endpoint is called the following happens:

- ai user with id `ai-bot-{channel-id}` is created using `admin` role, this way it can work on any channel by default.
- the bot establishes a WS connection and joins the channel.
- on the new message event, the bot starts talking to Anthropic.
- a new empty message is created and a new event called `ai_indicator.update` with a `state` value of ‚ÄúAI_STATE_THINKING‚Äù is sent to the watchers.
- the message has a custom data field called `ai_generated` with the value of `true`, to tell the clients it‚Äôs AI generated. The sender is the AI Bot from the backend.
- when the response starts streaming, a new `ai_indicator.clear` event is sent to the watchers. In this case, the client should clear up the typing/thinking UI.
- in the meantime, the response is streamed, and every 15th chunk is updating the message‚Äôs text  (which is cumulative of all the new ones since the last update). At the start, more chunks are sent to improve responsiveness (this is handled server side).
- when the streaming finishes, the message is updated with its final state.
- we also have an error state `AI_STATE_ERROR` when something went wrong.
- Translations for the texts should be done client side, based on the state. Currently we have:
   - `AI_STATE_THINKING` ‚Üí ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù
   - `AI_STATE_CHECKING_SOURCES` ‚Üí ‚ÄúChecking external sources‚Äù
   - in the other states, the indicator is not shown.

## Stopping the AI Agent

When the client doesn‚Äôt need the agent anymore, it should stop it, by calling the /stop-ai-agent endpoint. This will disconnect the user and remove it from the channel.
