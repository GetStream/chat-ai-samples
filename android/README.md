# [Android Compose](https://getstream.io/tutorials/android-chat/) AI Sample App

This official repository for Stream Chat's UI components is tailored for AI-first applications built with Compose UI. When combined with our real-time [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/), it simplifies integration and response rendering from LLM providers like ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic, or custom backends. The repository offers a rich set of out-of-the-box components capable of rendering Markdown, code blocks, tables, typing indicators, images, and more, providing a seamless developer experience for creating advanced conversational interfaces.

This repository demonstrates the following key features:

- Seamless integration of Stream SDK's AI capabilities to handle chunked streaming responses as UI states.
- Robust event handling to manage status changes, including activity indicators from the Stream SDK.
- Real-time display of AI-generated assistant messages accompanied by dynamic loading indicators.
- Complete implementation of UI elements using **Jetpack Compose** for a modern and declarative approach.
- Fully supports markdown formats, such as code highlighting, tables, LaTeX formulas.
- Efficient execution of business logic using **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous programming.
